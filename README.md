## ▶️ How to Run

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManikantaSindiri/TicTacToe-Python.git

```
###Step 2: Go to Project Folder
````
cd TicTacToe-Python
````
Step 3: Run Game
```
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
###How to Play

**The game board is a 3x3 grid

**Enter moves in this format:

**row column

**Example:
```
0 2

```
**The game automatically announces:

**Winner 🎉

**Or Draw 🤝

**Choose to replay after each match

###🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Add AI opponent using Minimax Algorithm

- **Convert to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Build GUI using Tkinter / Pygame

- **Online multiplayer mode

###⭐ Support
